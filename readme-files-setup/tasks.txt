    - e.g., workExperiences, openSource, bigProjects, blogSection, etc.



Data generation and consumption:

    [Build/Start step]
    |
    v
    [fetch.js (Node, before CRA build/dev)]
    - Reads env (.env)
    - Fetches GitHub GraphQL -> writes public/profile.json
    - Fetches Medium RSS (rss2json) -> writes public/blogs.json

    [Runtime in browser]
    |
    v
    - Projects.js    -> fetch(PUBLIC_URL + /profile.json) -> pinned repos
    - Profile.js     -> fetch(PUBLIC_URL + /profile.json) -> user profile
    - Blogs.js       -> fetch(PUBLIC_URL + /blogs.json)   -> medium posts
